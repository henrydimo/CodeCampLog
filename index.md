### Thursday June 29th 2017

- Today, I worked a lot on further developing my portfolio page. I tried as much as possible to keep it as simple as possible, touching up on the image border radius, alignment and so on. I did learn a very valuable lesson though, that you can't use someoneelse's code without studying it first. I got stumped at certain moments because of this and had to go back to my original idea. Web development is like art, stick to your ideas and your thing, always.

### Friday June 30th 2017

- We did a lot of indepth bootstrapping today. Ebuka invited his friend Kennedy over to enlighten us further about the uses of the bootstrap framework. Columns, rows, classes etc... A very engaging class.

- But what especially stood out today as an activity was the induction ceremony we had with the people from Stonebricks Hub and TheHashHub. We were really encouraged to think, create and iterate new ideas/concepts that can provide solutions in today's economy, while also being profitable enterpreneurs.
