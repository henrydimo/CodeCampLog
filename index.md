- Today, I worked a lot on further developing my portfolio page. I tried as much as possible to keep it as simple as possible, touching up on the image border radius, alignment and so on. I did learn a very valuable lesson though, that you can't use someoneelse's code without studying it first. I got stumped at certain moments because of this and had to go back to my original idea. Web development is like art, stick to your ideas and your thing, always.
